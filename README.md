## Features

1. **Filtering Songs**: Filter songs based on genre, artist, release year, and metadata (e.g., danceability, energy).
2. **Full-Text Search**: Search for songs by lyrics or titles with optimized PostgreSQL indexing.
3. **Playlist Management**: Create, update, and organize playlists dynamically.
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Get tailored song suggestions based on playback history.
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Handle large datasets with optimized queries and relationships.
6. **Interactive User Interface**: Real-time music exploration using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

### **Backend**
- **Python**: For backend logic and database interaction.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `psycopg2`.

### **Database**
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational database management, full-text search, and efficient queries.

### **Frontend**
- **Streamlit**: For building an intuitive and interactive web interface.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

### **API**
- **Deezer API**: Used to fetch real-time music data (tracks, artists, albums). 

### **Data Preprocessing**
- **CSV Files**: Dataset of 28,000+ songs (`dataset.csv`) used for populating the database.
- **Python Scripts**:
  - `populate_database.py`: Loads the dataset into the PostgreSQL database.
  - `random_user.py`: Generates mock user data for testing.

### **CI/CD**
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment, ensuring code quality and seamless updates.

### **Version Control**
- **Git and GitHub**: For team collaboration and version control.

## Database Schema

The TOBBify database schema includes:
- **Entities**: `Users`, `Songs`, `Playlists`, `Albums`, `Artists`, `Genres`, `Lyrics`, and more.
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many: `Albums ↔ Songs`, `Users ↔ Playlists`.
  - Many-to-Many: `Playlists ↔ Songs`, `Songs ↔ Genres`.
  - Optional: `Songs ↔ Lyrics` (one-to-one, optional).
- **Inheritance**: `Performers` generalized into `Artists` and `Artist Groups`.

The detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) is as follows:

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install and Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Download and install PostgreSQL from [PostgreSQL Official Website](https://www.postgresql.org/).
   - Create a new database (e.g., `tobbify`).

2. **Run Database Setup Script**:
   - Create database tables by running the `./db/create_tables.sql` script:

3. **Populate the Database**:
   - Populate the database by running the `./populate_database.py` script:
   - Execute the `./random_user.py` script to generate mock user data:
   - Populate the database by running the `./db/test_user.sql` script:

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Launch the Streamlit application using the following command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run ./app/main.py
     ```
